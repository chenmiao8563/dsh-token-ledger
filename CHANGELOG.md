## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Host plugin `token-ledger` that folds the durable session event stream into
  per-session, per-day and per-model token totals.
- Four disjoint buckets (uncached input, output, cache read, cache write) with
  `totalTokens` derived from them, plus reasoning tokens reported separately as
  a subset of output.
- Fork-aware folding: an inherited prefix is cut only when the session has a
  parent, so a fork is not double counted and a resume is not under counted.
- Backfill of every stored session on startup, so a fresh install shows real
  history rather than starting from zero.
- Restart-safe cursors: the ledger is written atomically to
  `<DSH_HOME>/token-ledger/ledger.json` and resumes instead of recounting.
- `/tokens [summary|export|json|path]` conversation command.
- `dsh-token-ledger` CLI with `summary`, `audit`, `rebuild` and `export`
  commands, `--json` output, and an audit that distinguishes a ledger merely
  behind a live session from a genuinely wrong ledger.
- CSV export for the daily, session and model tables.
- Zero runtime dependencies, zero peer dependencies and no install scripts, so
  the package installs without a build step.
